			<p>Thanks for signing up for <a href="http://onlyinpgh.com">OnlyinPgh's</a> new Scene System! We'll be launching a private beta of the system soon, and since you're the kind of <strong>pro-active</strong>, <strong>awesome</strong> person we're looking for, you'll be one of the first with the chance to try it out.</p>

			<p>If that's not good enough and you're interested in trying it out BEFORE it's even live, reply to this email and we'll talk. </p>

			<p>Stay tuned for more updates as we get closer to launching :)</p>
			<br />
			<p>Sincerely,</p>
			<p class="from">The OnlyinPgh Team</p>
